## Solution TeamCode

Author: William Irwin
Version: v1.1.1

TeamCode contains the code, info, and other ideas created by FTC (First Tech Challenge) team number
8528.  Copying this code is violating the first policy of "gracious professionalism" and is not
appreciated by this team.

Descriptions of the Java classes in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode Engine:
  = Autonomous =
Autonomous details robot instructions which have to run without human input
  = West Coast =
West Coast details robot instructions used by the team to control the robot

New changes in version 1.1 (Robot rebuild)
 = West Coast (One Controller) was removed
 = Autonomous was cleaned up and rebuilt

Notes (for all the world to see)
 - Rhyme Know Reason is lit
 - I support Joe's individuality
 - Skylar is a silly goose
